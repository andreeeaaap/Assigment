I redesigned the skip selection page to make it more modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing. The new design features a clean, card-based layout with subtle shadows and rounded corners, using a professional color scheme with green accents on a neutral background. Typography and spacing have been improved for better readability.

To enhance the user experience, I ensured that selecting a skip provides instant visual feedback, with all key details visible at a glance, eliminating the need for dropdowns. A sticky action bar helps users navigate easily. The page is fully responsive, working seamlessly across all devices.

Key functional improvements include size badges for quick identification, a structured pricing display that clearly shows VAT, and an organized layout with easy-to-scan grids. Important features are highlighted with checkmarks for clarity.

On the technical side, I improved API data handling with fallback values, added smoother loading states with an animated spinner, and implemented clear error handling with recovery options. Mobile usability has been enhanced with better touch targets.

To make interactions feel more intuitive, I included hover effects on interactive elements, a clearly differentiated selected state, and smooth animated transitions.

Overall, these changes make the page look more professional, help users make faster decisions, reduce cognitive load, and increase trust in the service.
